Adds an embed code for embedding idno posts into your wordpress blog.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you simply add an idno post into your wordpress blog, via an embed code, 
providing that the idno site also runs Embedded Posts <https://github.com/mapkyca/IdnoEmbeddedPosts>

This was mainly written to scratch an itch.

Once installed you will be able to link to an idno post by using the following
short code:

[known]post permalink url[/known]

You can also specify width and height of the embed, e.g.

[known width="xxx" height="yyy"]permalink url[/known]

== Installation ==

1. Upload /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Unzip
3. Activate through the plugins menu
